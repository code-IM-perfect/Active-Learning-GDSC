Assignment : 

Q1. Write a program to load the iris dataset. and perform the following operations:
1. Compute histogram of all columns and scatter plots
2. Finding the mean, median, mode, and standard deviations of numerical columns


Q2. Complete the followng prompts 

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Question 1:
# Using NumPy, create a 3D array of shape (4, 4, 4) filled with random numbers between 1 and 100. 
# Find the mean value of this array.

# Question 2:
# With Pandas, read a CSV file into a DataFrame. Then, filter the rows where a specific column's value is greater than a certain threshold.
# Example: Read 'data.csv' and filter rows where 'age' > 30.

# Question 3:
# Using Matplotlib, plot a line graph showing the trend of a numerical dataset. 
# Customize the plot with title, axis labels, and a legend.

# Question 4:
# Create a Pandas DataFrame with random values and perform the following operations:
# - Replace NaN values with the mean of the column.
# - Sort the DataFrame based on two columns.

# Question 5:
# Using NumPy, calculate the dot product of two matrices and find the determinant of the resulting matrix.

# Question 6:
# With Pandas, group a DataFrame by a categorical column and calculate the sum of another numerical column for each group.

# Question 7:
# Create a histogram using Matplotlib to show the distribution of a numerical dataset. 
# Customize the number of bins and add grid lines for better readability.

# Question 8:
# Using NumPy, create a 2D array and perform a slicing operation to extract a specific sub-array.

# Question 9:
# With Pandas, perform a merge operation between two DataFrames based on a common column.

# Question 10:
# Using Matplotlib, create a scatter plot comparing two numerical variables in a dataset. 
# Customize the plot by changing the color and shape of the data points.

# Each question requires you to write a script to perform the specified task and analyze the results.


The submission should be 2 seperate notebooks. Make the repo public and ping me (personally, when you are done)
